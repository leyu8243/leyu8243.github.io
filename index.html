<p style="color:White; font-family:'Courier New';"><b>Project Overview</b></p>
<p style="color:White; font-family:'Courier New';">In this course, I have created a weather station which reads the weather in terms of temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, and UV radiation. To collect this data, I used a Raspberry Pi pico board as well as a collection of Adafruit sensors which were connected with Arduino.</p>
